In the docker-compose file, I am making use of the images that were already defined in part 1.
It is also possible to define a new set entirely, like that:


version: '3.5'

services:

    frontend:
      image: example-frontend
      environment:
        - REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
      ports:
        - 5000:5000
      command: ["serve", "-s", "-l", "5000", "build"]

    backend:
      image: example-backend
      environment:
        - REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5000
      ports:
        - 8000:8000
      command: ["./server"]
